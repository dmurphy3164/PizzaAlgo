Call Pepe's
Ask to place an order for pickup
Order a 16" Meat Lover's Pizza
Drive to Pepe's and find parking
If they get your order wrong, politly inform them that you ordered a meatlover's pizza
You may have to wait an additional 20 min... It is worth it 
Once your order is ready, prepair to drive home. 
Make sure your pizza box is not on the car seat or floor directly
The pizza is deceptively greesy and sometimes the greese goes through the box
Have fun and enjoy
